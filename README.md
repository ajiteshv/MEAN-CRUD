# MEAN-CRUD
A simple project to demonstrate the capabilities of the MEAN stack. 
To start working, clone this repository to your local machine and execute the following commands:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ node server.js
$ gulp
```

I strongly advice using Nodemon for NodeJS development purposes. 

```
$ npm install -g nodemon
```
